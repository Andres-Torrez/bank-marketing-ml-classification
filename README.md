## Project Summary

This project implements a complete end-to-end Machine Learning system, covering the full lifecycle from data exploration to production deployment.

### Key capabilities:
- Data preprocessing with leakage control  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Production-ready web app  
- Feedback logging system  
- Retraining pipeline  
- Docker containerization  
- Cloud deployment  

---

## Business Case

Banks conduct marketing campaigns to promote term deposits.

**The goal:**  
Predict which clients are most likely to subscribe *before* contacting them.

**Why it matters:**
- Reduce unnecessary calls  
- Increase conversion rate  
- Optimize campaign efficiency  

---

## Dataset Overview

- **Dataset:** Bank Marketing Dataset  
- **Samples:** 45,211  
- **Target:** `y` (yes/no)

### ⚠️ Challenges:
- Imbalanced dataset (~11.7% positive)  
- Presence of data leakage variable (`duration`)  
- High number of categorical features

## Data Processing & Leakage Control

**Critical Decision:**  
❌ Removed `duration`  
- Known *after* the call  
- Causes data leakage  
- Makes model unrealistic  

### Additional Steps:
✔ Treated `"unknown"` as valid category  
✔ Stratified split  
✔ Pipeline-based transformations  

---

## Modeling Approach

### Models evaluated:
- DummyClassifier  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- HistGradientBoosting  

### Selection Criteria:
- ROC-AUC (primary)  
- Recall (minority class)  
- Overfitting control  

---

## Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Method:** RandomizedSearchCV  
- **CV:** Stratified K-Fold (5)  
- **Iterations:** 20  

### Final Model:
 **Tuned GradientBoostingClassifier**

---

## Final Model Performance

| Metric     | Value |
|------------|-------|
| ROC-AUC    | 0.805 |
| F1 Score   | 0.381 |
| Recall     | 0.269 |
| Precision  | 0.648 |
| Accuracy   | 0.897 |
| Gap        | 0.049 |

---

## Interpretation

- Strong ranking ability (ROC-AUC > 0.80)  
- Balanced precision/recall  
- Controlled overfitting  

---

## Baseline Comparison

Outperformed:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Dummy baseline  

---

## Testing

Tests implemented:
- ✔ Leakage validation  
- ✔ Stratified split  
- ✔ Feature validation  
- ✔ Minimum performance thresholds  

Run:
```
uv run pytest
```
